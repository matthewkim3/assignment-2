# Assignment-2-Types-Operators-Expressions

Please fill in the code for all programs here.  I recommend the following
order (ranked from least difficult to most)

1. `variables`
2. `relations`
3. `factorial`
4. `temperature`
5. `quadratic`
6. `upper`
7. `binary`

To run your code, I am going to run the `make` command which follows the
instructions in `Makefile`.  You can do the same to make sure it looks okay
before sending it to me.
